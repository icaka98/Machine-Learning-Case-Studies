<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Machine Learning Case Studies gathers a collection of Data Analysis and Machine Learning studies performed under the supervision of Prof. G. Spanakis from Maastricht University. Each Jupyter notebook corresponds to a particular topic with the exception of the 'Flu Madness' Kaggle Solution which incorporates many techniques from Data Analysis and Machine Learning. The main topics covered are: Exploratory Data Analysis, Classification, Regression Techniques, Dimensionality Reduction, Timeseries and more. Each case study is accompanied by deep explanation and a thorough conclusion.
